# Correction of distractor-bound saccades depends on availability of evidence.
N.E. DiQuattro J.J. Geng

## Experiment 1
The question was to determine the saccade metrics that distinguish saccades to a dissimilar versus similar distractor.

### Methods
#### Participants
Twenty-four UC Davis undergraduates (11 Male, 3 Left handed, ages 19-27) participated for class credit. Each provided written informed consent in accordance with the local ethics clearance as approved by the National Institutes of Health. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

#### Procedure
Each trial began with a fixation dot (subtending .25° of visual angle; gray; 8.51 cd/m<sup>2</sup>) centrally presented on a black background(.23 cd/m<sup>2</sup>). For the majority of trials, two squares (each subtending 1° of visual angle; one rotated 45°, resembling a diamond) appeared along an imaginary circle with a radius of 5° visual angle. The diamond could appear at one of six locations along the imaginary circle, with the other square always appearing at its antipode. Each square contained a black cross that was either upright or inverted. Participants were instructed to report the orientation of the cross within the diamond by a key press, making the diamond the target object. The target's color was maintained throughout the experiment (e.g. always green), while the distractor square would vary between a high contrast color (white; 198 cd/m<sup>2</sup>), a neutral color (purple; 9.8 cd/m<sup>2</sup>), or the same color as the target (green; 17.1 cd/m<sup>2</sup>) on a trial-by-trial basis. The task display remained on screen for 500ms after which an inter-trial interval of 1500 – 2000ms occurred, during which only the fixation dot appeared. On a subset of trials no target appeared (i.e. the task display consisted of two distractor squares), in which cases the participants were instructed to withhold a response. These "catch trials" consisted of either two target-colored squares or a high-contrast square paired with the non-target color. Target color (green or purple) was counter-balanced across subjects.

#### Design
Our experimental conditions were based on a combination of distractor type (dissimilar or similar)  and first saccade destination (target or distractor). The dissimilar distractor condition collapses across trials with a high contrast and neutral color distractor due to insignificant differences in our dependent measures between those distractor types (see Results). The similar condition contained trials where the distractor was the same color as the target.

#### Apparatus
Prior to the start of each trial, fixation of the centrally presented gray dot was enforced for 100ms via an Eyelink 1000 (SR Research, ON) desk-mounted system sampling at 500hz. Eye-movements were also recorded for the duration of the task display. 

### Conclusions
That there are three saccade metrics that distinguish dissimilar vs. similar distractors. Specifically, latency (prob just capture), amplitude, and fixation duration (might be next saccade latency).

## Experiment 2
In the previous experiment we established that there were multiple sacccade metrics .....
The purpose of this experiment was then to understand the temporal dynamics of saccade correction mechanisms. If the correction mechanisms are affected by SOA, then that means that they are based on information gathered at the initial fixation (before the first saccade had been executed). If there is post-saccadic processing, then the correction metrics should be identical over SOA.

### Methods
#### Participants
Twenty-four UC Davis undergraduates (9 Male, All right handed, ages 18-28) participated for class credit. Each provided written informed consent in accordance with the local ethics clearance as approved by the National Institutes of Health. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

#### Procedure
Methods for experiment 2 were identical to experiment 1 except for a key difference. In experiment 2, a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between target and distractor onset was introduced that resulted in the distractor possibly appearing 103ms, 68ms, or 33ms before or after target onset, in addition to simultaneous onset (as in experiment 1).

#### Design
The addition of the SOA manipulation resulted in twenty-eight experimental conditions (7 SOAs x 2 distractor types x 2 saccade destination). We restricted our analyses to SOA intervals that resulted in the distractor appearing prior to or simultaneously with the target and distractor-bound first saccades due to our specific objective of investigating distractor processing, resulting in eight conditions of interest.   

Always a target present.

### Conclusions
SOA matters when the dissimilar distractor precedes the target for amplitude. This suggest that the ability to correct saccades with stopping short depends on information gathered at the initial fixation about the target (i.e., the second onset), but also potentially about the distractor itself. But the ability to initiate the next saccade to the target is not differentially affected by distractor type; overall there is shorter fixation durations when target information is available earlier, but this was non-specific to the distractor type, suggesting that this aspect of correction was based purely on the onset of the target (i.e., the second object). Together these results suggest that "stopping short" and shorter fixation durations may rely on partially distinct information.

So overall it appears that the presence of the target initiates correction mechanisms reflected in the amplitude and the fixation duration (or second saccade latency). But what we don't know if the trigger for this correction is the target, specifically, or if it just the presence of another object. Therefore we run Exp 3.

Specifically, there was an interaction between distractor type and SOA such that latencies were shorter overall to the dissimilar distractor, but more importantly, the latency to dissimilar distractors did not change with SOA (i.e., decreasing temporal advantage for distractor) but there was an increase in latency for the similar distractor with decreasing SOA suggesting greater competition from the late-onset target. This suggests that the dissimilar distractor captured attention and that latency reflects bottom-up competition, but not correction mechanisms. 

More importantly, the effect of SOA for amplitude there was no effect of SOA for similar distractors, but the amplitude decreased with decreasing SOA. This suggests that the sooner target information was available, the greater the correction in saccade amplitude. However, even at the longest SOA, amplitude was shorter for dissimilar compared to similar distractors. For fixation duration there is just a main effect such that fixation durations were shorter for the dissimilar compared to the similar distractor. There was a main effect of SOA such that fixation duration decreases as SOA decreases.

## Experiment 3

Purpose of Experiment 3 was to test whether the identity of the second onset (i.e., the target or another distractor) modulates correction mechanisms (i.e., amplitude and fixation duration) seen in Experiment 2.

### Methods
#### Participants
Twenty-four UC Davis undergraduates (8 Male, All right handed, ages 18-23) participated for class credit. Each provided written informed consent in accordance with the local ethics clearance as approved by the National Institutes of Health. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

#### Procedure
Methods for experiment 3 were identical to experiment 2 except for two key differences. In experiment 3, every trial had a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between target and distractor onset of 68ms and the task display could contain every possible pair of distractors, distractor and target, or target alone.

#### Design
Presenting every possible pair of stimuli in each SOA interval resulted in 18 experimental conditions. We restricted our analysis to trials where a distractor appeared first with the second onset either being a target or dissimilar distractor, resulting in three conditions of interest.
